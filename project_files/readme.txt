*** Software project ***

Please read the following regarding the unit tests:

* In order to run the unit tests please verify that '/unit_tests/main_testers.cpp' file is fully un-commented and run
  'testers_makefile' instead if 'makefile'

* There is no need to do any special action if you do not want to compile the unit tests, yet if you are working with an IDE,
  you should verify that '/unit_tests/main_testers.cpp' is fully commented
